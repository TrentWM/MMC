#M/M/c Markovian Multiserver Queues

## Overview

This repo contains files needed for simulation of M/M/c queues in Python.  The project is just beginning, and as of 12/15/16 only contains the basic module as well as sample simulations.  Further tests as well as refinements to the module itself should follow in the next month or so.
